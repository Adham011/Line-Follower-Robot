## Key Features
Intelligent Navigation & Obstacle Avoidance: The robot follows paths and avoids obstacles using real-time sensor data.
Hardware Implementation: Built and programmed the robot’s hardware components with Arduino and C for practical deployment.

## Components
Microcontroller: Arduino
Programming Language: C
Sensors: Line sensors for path detection, obstacle sensors for collision avoidance
Actuators: Motors for movement control
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone 
##  
    https://github.com/yourusername/line-follower-obstacle-avoiding-robot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

## 
    cd line-follower-obstacle-avoiding-robot
Upload the code:
1. Open the line_follower_obstacle_avoiding_robot.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
3. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
## Usage
Assemble the Robot:

Follow the provided hardware assembly instructions to build the robot.
Ensure all sensors and motors are correctly connected to the Arduino board.
Power On:

Power on the robot and place it on the path with obstacles.
Observe:

The robot will follow the path and navigate around obstacles autonomously.
